# Microcontrollers #  

The previous section made use of a simulator. In this section, we make use of a real microcontroller with sensors.  
_**(Note to protect the sensor, you may have to connect a pullup resistor between the microcontroller and the sensor)**_   

## Arduino sketch code with MQ4 Gas Sensor ##   
This section explains how you can connect gas sensors MQ4 to Arduino.  

1. If Arduino sketch is not installed, download and install Arduino sketch program from the link  https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/sketchConnect .  

2. Connect the Arduino Uno (or other  flavours of Arduino) to MacOSX / Windows / Linux using USB port.  

3. Download the lpg_gas_sensor.ino file.

4. Verify the code by clicking on the top-right tick mark.

5. Upload the code to the Arduino.

6. Disconnect the Arduino Uno from the development system.

7. Connect MQ4 Gas sensor to Arduino by connecting   
a. Vcc pint of Gas Sensor to 5V pin of Arduino  
b. Gnd pin of Gas Sensor to Gnd pin of Arduino  
c. A0 pin of Gas Sensor to A0 pin of Arduino

8. Connect the Arduino (with the Gas Sensor) back to the development system.  

9. Click on System Monitor and observe the readings.
