# Tinkering Lab #  

## Introduction ##  
This session covers simulation, actual microcontroller and connecting microcontroller to IoT Cloud platform.  


Proceed in the following format   
    
1. [Browser based simulator](simulator/README.md) and proceeds next to    
2. An [actual sensor connected to Arduino Uno](microcontroller/README.md). Finally this device data-points are sent to
3. [IBM Watson IoT Quickstart dashboard using Node-RED flow](node_red/README.md).
